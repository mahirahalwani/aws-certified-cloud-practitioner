## What is Cloud Computing?

  &emsp;- Compute: CPU, to do some calculations and find results
  &emsp;- Memory: RAM, a very fast memory to allow storing of information
  &emsp;- Storage: Data, special storage to store data
  &emsp;- Database: store data in a structured way
  &emsp;- Network: routers, switch, DNS server
- IT terminology:
  &emsp;- Network: cables, routers and servers connected with each other
  &emsp;- Router: a networking device that forwards data packet between computer networks. They know where to send your packets on the internet.
  &emsp;- Switch: takes a packet and send it to the correct server/client on your network
